# rsa-simulation

This project is written with the intent to simulate 
how the RSA Encryption scheme works based on the mathematics behind it on a basic level.

In order to implement this the main concepts to be implemented are the following:
     - Prime Factorization & (Fermat Factorization)
     - Euler-phi function
     - Modular Arithmetic Theorem
     - Text Conversion
