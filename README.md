# rsa-simulation

This project is written with the intent to simulate 
how the RSA Encryption scheme works based on the mathematics behind it on a basic level.

In order to implement this the main concepts to be implemented are the following:\n
     - Prime Factorization & (Fermat Factorization)\n
     - Euler-phi function\n
     - Modular Arithmetic Theorem\n
     - Text Conversion\n
